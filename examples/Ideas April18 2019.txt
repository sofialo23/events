1. 
In order to make the search more specific,
we need to add a table with the list of categories
and link it with a foreign key in the activity_notif


2.
For the predictions on searching
we need one more table in DB that will save:
user_name, department_id, category_id

3.
we will not make suggestions based on the date
selected on the search.
We will always recommend the soon coming activities,
separately we also show based on recent searches (by category or by department)
